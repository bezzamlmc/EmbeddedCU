=========================

Location Top segment or Type : Code, Data, Peripheral, Register, None
Location Sub-segment : Stack, Heap, BSS, Data, const/rodata, None
Access Permissions  : Read (R), Write (W) Read-write (RW), None
Lifetime : Function/Block, Program, Indefinite, None

Sub-Segment: 1(stack),2(heap),3(BSS),4(Data),5(const/rodata),6(none),7(text)
Permissions:1(read),2(write),3(r/w),4(none)
Lifetime:1(function/block),2(program),3(indefinite),4(none)
